I'm a passionate software engineer from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·. My enthusiasm for open-source projects brings people together globally and propels us toward a brighter future. When I'm not coding, you'll catch me indulging in mountain biking, playing Counter-Strike, volleyball, or assisting beginners with coding.

My focus is on full-stack development. I embarked on my coding journey in late 2018 with Java, initially experimenting with Minecraft plugins. Since then, I've expanded my skills to develop a range of applications, from SaaS enterprise projects to a TypeScript framework, and even my own programming language.
