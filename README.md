I'm a passionate software engineer from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·. My love for open source projects connects people worldwide and drives us toward a better future. When I'm not coding, you'll find me enjoying mountain biking, playing Counter-Strike, volleyball, or helping beginners with coding.

I'm dedicated to full-stack development. I started my coding journey in late 2018 with Java, initially tinkering with Minecraft plugins. Since then, I've grown to develop various applications, including SaaS enterprise projects, a TypeScript framework, and even my own programming language.
