I'm a passionate software engineer from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·. My love for open source projects
connects people worldwide and drives us toward a better future. When I'm not coding,
you'll find me enjoying mountain biking, playing Counter-Strike, volleyball, or helping
beginners with coding.

I'm dedicated to full-stack development. I started my coding journey in late 2018 with
Java, initially tinkering with Minecraft plugins. Since then, I've grown to develop
various applications, including SaaS enterprise projects, a TypeScript framework, and even
my own programming language.
